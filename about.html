    <p>There is not much to talk about. 
        I do not like making forms because they bore me. 
        This however is a more modern take on what I would consider a forms page. 
        I believe I fulfilled the requirements within the Home and Services pages which are both accessible from this page. 
        This page and the Contact page are meant to fultill the requirement of being present.
        They are more like filler pages.
